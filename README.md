# Analysis-of-the-volume-of-seafood-products-marketed-from-marine-fishing-in-Morocco
## Overview

This project aims to conduct an analysis of the factors that influence the volume of coastal and artisanal fishing products in Morocco using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the R and Python programming languages.

## Data

The data used in this analysis has been extracted from the [hcp.ma](https://www.hcp.ma/) website and includes information on coastal and artisanal fishing in Morocco. The raw data can be found in the `data/` folder of this repository.

## Objectives

The main objective of this analysis is to determine the factors that have the most significant impact on the production of coastal fishing products in Morocco. We will seek to answer questions such as:

- What are the primary factors influencing the production of coastal fishing products in Morocco?
- Are there any interesting trends or correlations between different variables?
- How can this information be used to improve the management of coastal fishing in Morocco?

## Methodology

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify the most significant factors. R and Python scripts will be used to perform this analysis.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: This folder contains the raw data downloaded from hcp.ma.
- `scripts/`: R and Python scripts used for PCA are available here.
- `results/`: The results of the analysis will be stored in this folder.
- `README.md`: You are here, the project's README file.
